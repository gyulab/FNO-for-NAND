# 2D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) Surrogate Models

This directory contains the implementation of FNO-based surrogate models for 2D FeNAND devices.

## Contents

- **`Code/`**: 
  - Python scripts for training Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO).
  - Inference scripts for visualizing device physics (e.g., trapped charge evolution).

- **`Results/`**:
  - Stores training checkpoints (`.pt`), normalization statistics (`stats.pt`), and output visualizations.

## Documentation
- **`FeNAND-AI-Surrogate.pdf`**: Detailed background and methodology for the AI-based surrogate modeling approach used in this project.
