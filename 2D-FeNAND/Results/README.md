# 2D-FeNAND Results

This directory stores the outputs of the training and inference processes.

## Contents

- **`checkpoints/`**: 
  - Saved model weights (`best_model.pt`) from `train_model.py`.
  - `stats.pt`: Normalization statistics required for inference.

- **`checkpoints_pino/`**: 
  - Checkpoints from Physics-Informed training (`train_pino.py`).

- **`checkpoints_gate/`**:
  - Checkpoints from Gate-region specific training (`train_eTrappedCharge.py`).

- **`animations/`**:
  - GIFs generated by inference scripts illustrating device behavior (e.g., charge dynamics vs. temperature).
